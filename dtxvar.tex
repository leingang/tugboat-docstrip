\section{Introduction}

This is an example article for \TUB, linked from
\url{https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html}.

We recommend the \texttt{graphicx} package for image inclusions, and the
\texttt{hyperref} package if active urls are desired (in the \acro{PDF}
output).  Nowadays \TUB\ is produced using \acro{PDF} files exclusively.

The \texttt{ltugboat} class provides these abbreviations, among many others:

% verbatim blocks are often better in \small
\begin{verbatim}[\small]
\AllTeX \AMS \AmS \AmSLaTeX \AmSTeX \aw \AW
\BibTeX \Cplusplus \CTAN
\DTD \DVI
\HTML \LaTeXe
\MacOSX \MathML \MF \MFB
\plain \PS
\TANGLE \TB \TP
\TUB \TUG \tug
\UNIX \WEB \WEAVE
\XeLaTeX \XeTeX \XML

\, \bull \Dash \hyph \slash

\acro{FRED} -> {\small[er] fred}  % please use!
\cs{fred}   -> \fred
\meta{fred} -> <fred>
\nth{n}     -> 1st, 2nd, ...
\booktitle{Book of Fred}
\end{verbatim}

For references to other issues of \TUB, please use the format
\textsl{volno:issno}, e.g., ``\TUB\ 32:1'' for volume~32, number~1.

This file is just a template.  The \TUB\ style documentation is the
\texttt{ltubguid} document at \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/tugboat}.  (For
\CTAN\ references, where sensible we recommend that form of url, with
\texttt{/pkg/}; or, if you need to refer to a specific file location,
\texttt{http://mirror.ctan.org/\textsl{path}}.)

We recommend using \BibTeX (but don't require it).  The \texttt{biblio}
package on \CTAN, \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/biblio}, provides files
\texttt{tugboat.bib} with an essentially complete bibliography of \TUB,
and \texttt{texbook3.bib} with many \TeX-related citations.  Both of these,
and many more, should also already be in your \TeX\ distribution.

Email \verb|tugboat@tug.org| with any problems or questions.

\bibliographystyle{tugboat}% or plain if you don't have tugboat.bst
\nocite{book-minimal}      % just making the bibliography non-empty
\bibliography{xampl}       % xampl.bib comes with BibTeX
