\begin{abstract}
    I describe a method of keeping multiple variants of the same document
    within the same file using \docstrip.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

As a college professor, there are several times when I need to keep teaching
materials in several different forms.  For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A single class day's lesson might consist of lecture slides in the
    \cls{beamer} class, a handout of the same slides printed 2â€“3 on a page for
    student notes, my own lecture notes in \cls{beamer} with the
    \pkg{beamerarticle} package loaded, a worksheet for distribution, and
    solutions to the worksheet.

    \item A single week's homework assignment might consist of problem
    statements, with hints and reading notes, a \LaTeX{} template for students
    to fill in with their own answers, and solutions with comments to be
    published after the assignment has been graded.
\end{itemize}

Over the years I have developed a workflow for writing these bundles of
documents in the same file, using the \LaTeX{} \docstrip{} utility.  In this
article I will introduce the reader to \docstrip{} and explain how I use it.
